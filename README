aspreify - reify answer set programs

The purpose of this program is to parse textual answer set programs
(ASP, Prolog like syntax) as accepted by lparse
(http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/) and produce a description of
the input program as ASP facts, effectively reifying the input program
allowing, among other things, ASP programs to be interpreted or
modified by other ASP programs.

1. Building 

Requires Haskell platform, tested on 2012.2.0.0. 
To produce an executable:
> ghc -o aspreify main.hs rdfrender.hs txtrender.hs factrender.hs aspparse.hs 

A simple test:
> ./aspreify tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp
produces tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp.reified 

> ./aspreify -t tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp
The result has the same rules, used for testing.
tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp.lp

> ./aspreify -r tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp
The result is and RDF/N3-like format. 
tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp.ssls
 
2. Limitations 

2.1 Error handling is rudimentary, syntax errors are reported, but often
    indicated to be after the actual error. 

2.2 Non-supported syntax 
TODO 
List here the smodels tests which do not work and why 

3. Other documentation
