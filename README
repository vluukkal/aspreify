aspparse - reify answer set programming programs

The purpose of this program is to parse textual answer set programs
(ASP) as accepted by lparse (http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/)
and produce a description of the input program as ASP facts,
effectively reifying the input program allowing, among other things,
ASP programs to be interpreted or modified by other ASP programs.

1. Building 

Requires Haskell platform, tested on 2012.2.0.0. 
To produce an executable:
> ghc -o aspparse main.hs rdfrender.hs txtrender.hs factrender.hs aspparse.hs 

A simple test:
> ./aspparse tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp
produces tests/hamiltonian_cycle.lp.reified 

2. Limitations 

2.1 Code for RDF rendering exists, but not accessible from commandline. 

2.2 Non-supported syntax 
TODO 
List here the smodels tests which do not work and why
